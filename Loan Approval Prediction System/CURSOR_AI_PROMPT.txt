Build a complete Loan Approval Prediction System with the following specifications:

PROJECT STRUCTURE:
Create this exact structure:
- app.py (Flask/FastAPI main application)
- models/loan_model.py (ML model training and prediction)
- models/preprocessor.py (data preprocessing)
- models/trained_models/ (saved models directory)
- data/loan_dataset.csv (500-1000 sample records)
- templates/index.html (main prediction form)
- templates/dashboard.html (model metrics dashboard)
- static/css/style.css (modern styling)
- static/js/main.js (frontend logic)
- utils/data_loader.py, utils/validators.py
- tests/ (test files)
- requirements.txt, README.md

MACHINE LEARNING:
- Train multiple models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Features: Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self_Employed, ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, LoanAmount, Loan_Amount_Term, Credit_History, Property_Area
- Target: Loan_Status (Y/N)
- Save models with joblib
- Display: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, ROC curve
- Feature importance visualization

WEB APPLICATION:
- Backend: Flask or FastAPI with these endpoints:
  * POST /predict - accepts JSON with all features, returns prediction + probability
  * GET /model/performance - returns model metrics
  * GET /model/info - returns feature importance
  * GET /health - health check
- Frontend: Modern responsive UI with:
  * Loan application form (all input fields with validation)
  * Real-time prediction display
  * Probability visualization (progress bars, charts)
  * Model dashboard with metrics and visualizations
  * Use Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for styling
  * Chart.js or Plotly for charts

DATA:
- Create realistic loan_dataset.csv with columns: Loan_ID, Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self_Employed, ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, LoanAmount, Loan_Amount_Term, Credit_History, Property_Area, Loan_Status
- Handle missing values, encode categoricals, scale features
- Validate all user inputs

CODE QUALITY:
- PEP 8 compliant
- Type hints for all functions
- Docstrings for all functions/classes
- Comprehensive error handling
- Logging throughout
- Unit tests (70%+ coverage)

UI/UX:
- Professional design (blues/greens for approval, reds for rejection)
- Mobile responsive
- Loading indicators
- Clear error messages
- Success notifications
- Interactive charts

DELIVERABLES:
1. Complete working application
2. Trained models with >75% accuracy
3. Sample dataset
4. All tests passing
5. Comprehensive README with setup instructions

IMPLEMENTATION ORDER:
1. Create project structure and requirements.txt
2. Generate sample dataset
3. Build preprocessing pipeline
4. Train and save models
5. Create API endpoints
6. Build frontend UI
7. Add visualizations
8. Write tests
9. Create documentation
